**Those who remain is a multiplayer wave based FPS zombie game where you cooperate with your teammates to survive all 15 waves.**

I have played this game for months now and have reached level 90 which gives me the confidence to say that I'm fairly skilled and experienced in this game. Note that the peak [server](https://discord.gg/peakdev) provides a helpful community with a bunch of people who are higher level than I am.

### 0.0 Basics

In this game, there are 15 waves as specified earlier each being 5 minutes long. You survive each wave by using the means provided to you. There are objectives that can be done during each wave to earn extra credits and xp which are crucial for unlocking new items. To participate in a wave, you have to ready yourself for the upcoming wave meaning that you cannot join an ongoing wave without using spawn tokens(10 robux each). Note that once you die you can get revived by a teammate with the guardian angel perk instead of paying robux.

### 1.0 Infected

Zombies/Infected are your enemies so you have to survive each wave while trying to not get killed by them. You can kill them with weapons, throwables and fortifications. You can also run away from them which is also effective because rushing them head-on is the last thing you'd want to do.

Zombies have variants which will be listed below with some notes and ways to discern them from others. It is also worth knowing that zombies get stronger and faster each wave meaning that they could catch up to you at later waves and they'd have more health.

* Civilian

  Civilian zombies are the default ones which aren't as fast as others nor as strong.

* Sprinter

  Sprinters are just like civilians except they run faster than their default counterpart. They look the same as civilians but can be told apart with their speed therefore they'd be at the front of a horde.

* Bolter

  They are small, annoying and fast. They can always be recognized through their pose and can be detected with their screeching sounds. They are quite fast and can sprint then pounce towards the player within a certain radius. They deal low damage but that'll scale at later waves which is why they shouldn't be ignored when you're not on the energy drink's effect. Luckily these little creatures have the least amount of health and can be killed with a simple headshot with low level weapons at any wave.

* Military

  They are easily one of the most hated variants in this game since they have the longest reach, they're moderately fast and deal decent damage. They wear a military outfit that is said to absorb damage since they take more shots before dying compared to civilian zombies.

* Burster

  These aren't troublesome in general but they can at times; when killed by explosions or shot in the torso, bursters release a gas that deals damage upon impact and can deal damage while standing within that AOE meaning that teammates can kill you that way whether it's intentional or not. Their melee attacks deal a lot of damage as well. Bursters have weird stuff that stick out of their limbs which make them look like bloaters except they have a hunched back posture and walk faster than bloaters.

* Bloaters

  Bloaters can be nuisances when camping since they throw spores that deal a considerable amount of area damage upon impact. They are strong as well since they have a lot of health and their melee attacks deal a lot of damage. Luckily you won't need to worry about them when you're freerunning since they're even slower than bursters. They look similar to bursters except they have a straight posture.

* Riot

  Riots are pretty similar to bloaters in terms of stats meaning that they are slow, strong, bulky, etc. They have body armor that protects them from melee damage which is irrelevant in this game, they almost make them very much distinguishable from other variants.


### 2.0 Maps

TWR provides an assorted list of maps randomly chosen by the game at the end of each game(when wave 15 is beaten or a wave has been lost). Each map has its pros and cons along with camping spots due to their different fundemental nature meaning that you will have to incorporate different strategies to strive until the end of wave 15. In Cabin you would like to free run during late waves constantly whereas in expressway you have to stay on the right side and constantly shoot the zombies.

Here is a list of the maps with some info on them.

* Bypass

  A map that has 2 bridges that connects to the main part of it; flat terrain that is occupied by a small plaza, medical tents, barracks with a bunch of abandoned vehicles on the road that can be climbed on. Past the fortified bridge, there is a tunnel with a loot in them and doors where one of them leads to a camping spot. The zombies can spawn from the hill, from the tunnel, the bridge and around the fortitifed bridge.

* Mill

  A snowy map with a tunnel that is supposedly the same one in bypass and a bridge at the other side of the road that leads to a mountain pass path. This large map has an office place, a small cabin, a gas station, a warehouse, a forest and a factory. The factory's catwalks is a good camping spot and the zombies can run into the trees.

* Ranch

  Like its name suggests it, this map is a ranch with barns, a house and a small green house. The map is super vast and has fence that can be used to jump over and slow down infected.

* Expressway

  This map is a one-way map in other words the enemies spawn on one side and try to get you at the other one. This can either be problematic or an advantage; your teammates can be a burden and ruin everything by not staying on the right side. Staying on the right side allows zombies to line up and be shot down with ease. This map has a lot of vehicles and loot everywhere from the base to the edge of the map.

* Manor

  Manor is a relatively large map that can be considered as a maze for newcomers due to the amount of rooms and halls in it. The zombies come from around the wall. Since there are dozens of rooms, the relevant ones are the library, office, objectives located in specific rooms and the garage. It's worth noting that the garden situated at the center of the manor can be used as a shortcut to traverse from the front to the rear of the manor instead of running around it.
  
* Cabin

  Easily the most hated map due to its darkness and difficulty during later waves. Cabin has a cabin with a little amount of rooms and a basement, beyond that there is a truck near the cabin and a forest that encircles it. Camping in the basement is a bad idea and you should resort to free-running. The porch is really useful when freerunning because it provides loots. Zombies spawn from everywhere in the forest.
  
* District

  Just like Cabin, district is a fairly isolated and restricted map leaving not as much space to run in as other maps. It has 3 shooting places supposedly used by survivors before the players, a gas station, a movie theater and an apartment. Zombies come from multiple openings including the ground floor in the apartment and shooting spots.
  
* Prison

  Similarly to Manor, Prison is a pretty vast and has a lot of places for beginners to get lost in. There are multiple prison cell rooms, a kitchen, a mess hall, laundry, chapel, shower room, basketball court, outdoors gym. Outside of the main entrance there are police cars and a bus. Zombies spawn around the prison's perimeter.

* Cargo
  
  This map has a dark lighting setting similar to Cabin, it has a lot of cargo crates, a couple of medical tents and a ship that provides excellent camping spots. Like District, the zombies come from specific openings which are the ripped wire fences in this map.


### 3.0 Looting

Looting is essential in twr because you will definitely run out of ammo or take some damage. You can also loot fortifications, throwables and some items that'll buff your character.

Here are the throwables listed :

* Frag

  The classic frag grenade, explodes after shortly after thrown and deals explosive damage.

* Molotov

  Also referred to as the "molly", when thrown it'll break and create a fire AOE and deal fire damage.

* Nerf gas

  Creates an AOE of gas slowing down the infected within it.

Medical and non fortification loots are here :

* Medkit

  Heals a survivor to full health, it is ideal to use when your health is low.

* Bandages

  Heals a bar of health.

* Body armor

  Provides body armor, reduces physical damage by 50%. Physical means that bloater spores and burster gas bypass body armor.

* Ammo

  Adds ammunition into the player's ammo pool, usually a mag. It is ideal to not pick up a box of ammo when you don't need to so you won't waste any.

* Energy drink

  Increases player's walkspeed while the player is under its effect, lasts for 30 seconds.

Fortifications will be listed in the fortification chapter.


### 4.0 Objectives

Objectives in twr are tasks that you can perform. Upon completion, you will be awarded a mutable amount of credits and xp depending on the objective. Here are the objectives in the game :

* Escort

  You have to escort a survivor until you get awarded. 3000 credits and 1500 xp

* Radio/Communications/etc

  You stay in the circle for at least 30% to be awarded. A heli will arrive and drop a supply package which is the only way of acquiring a 50 cal. 1500 credits and 750 xp

* Resources

  Stay in the circle for at least 30% to be awarded just like Radio, you will have a bunch of supplies upon finishing the objective. To differeniate between ammo and medical supplies, you can find an ak47 on the objective whenever it objective supplies ammo. 2000 credits and 1000 xp

* Fill

  There's a bus and you have to fill it with resources, found in the map : water, propane, can packages, generator, toolbox. 3000 credits and 1500 xp

* Repair

  To repair the broken-down car, you have to find spark plugs, fuel and tires. 3000 credits and 1500 xp

* Destroy

  There's a gas truck, destroy it to cause an explosion with a fire field similar to the molotovs'. 5000 credits and 2000 xp

Both the repair and fill objectives require you to only pick up one item for you to be rewarded whenever accomplished but it is recommended to still help in order to actually finish it. Doing objectives at bad spots can get egregious for those who do it. Doing radio near infected spawns at wave 15 is suicidal, hence egregious.


### 5.0 Weapons

Weapons are mostly what keep you alive in this game, so you have to buy the proper ones and learn to use them the right way(s) as well. There are various weapons in this game but I will mention the ones relevant in this game; buying the proper ones is good to not waste any credits on buying the latter ones.

### 6.0 Perks

### 7.0 Fortification
