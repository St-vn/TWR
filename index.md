**Those who remain is a multiplayer wave based FPS zombie game where you cooperate with your teammates to survive all 15 waves.**
**Shoutout to DrKekson / keke#6484 for asking for one**

**Planning to add screenshots and more media to help visualize what is being documented**

I have played this game for months now and have reached level 90 which gives me the confidence to say that I'm fairly skilled and experienced in this game. Note that the [twr fandom wiki](https://those-who-remain.fandom.com/wiki/Those_Who_Remain_Wiki) provides useful information and that this repo is bound to change a lot.

### 0.0 Basics

In this game, there are 15 waves as specified earlier each being 5 minutes long. You survive each wave by using the means provided to you. There are objectives that can be done during each wave to earn extra credits and xp which are crucial for unlocking new items. To participate in a wave, you have to ready yourself for the upcoming wave meaning that you cannot join an ongoing wave without using spawn tokens(10 robux each). Note that once you die you can get revived by a teammate with the guardian angel perk instead of paying robux.

### 1.0 Infected

Zombies/Infected are your enemies so you have to survive each wave while trying to not get killed by them. You can kill them with weapons, throwables and fortifications. You can also run away from them which is also effective because rushing them head-on is the last thing you'd want to do.

Zombies have variants which will be listed below with some notes and ways to discern them from others. It is also worth knowing that zombies get stronger and faster each wave meaning that they could catch up to you at later waves and they'd have more health.

* Civilian

  Civilian zombies are the default ones which aren't as fast as others nor as strong.

* Sprinter

  Sprinters are just like civilians except they run faster than their default counterpart. They look the same as civilians but can be told apart with their speed therefore they'd be at the front of a horde.

* Bolter

  They are small, annoying and fast. They can always be recognized through their pose and can be detected with their screeching sounds. They are quite fast and can sprint then pounce towards the player within a certain radius. They deal low damage but that'll scale at later waves which is why they shouldn't be ignored when you're not on the energy drink's effect. Luckily these little creatures have the least amount of health and can be killed with a simple headshot with low level weapons at any wave.

* Military

  They are easily one of the most hated variants in this game since they have the longest reach, they're moderately fast and deal decent damage. They wear a military outfit that is said to absorb damage since they take more shots before dying compared to civilian zombies.

* Burster

  These aren't troublesome in general but they can at times; when killed by explosions or shot in the torso, bursters release a gas that deals damage upon impact and can deal damage while standing within that AOE meaning that teammates can kill you that way whether it's intentional or not. Their melee attacks deal a lot of damage as well. Bursters have weird stuff that stick out of their limbs which make them look like bloaters except they have a hunched back posture and walk faster than bloaters.

* Bloaters

  Bloaters can be nuisances when camping since they throw spores that deal a considerable amount of area damage upon impact. They are strong as well since they have a lot of health and their melee attacks deal a lot of damage. Luckily you won't need to worry about them when you're freerunning since they're even slower than bursters. They look similar to bursters except they have a straight posture.

* Riot

  Riots are pretty similar to bloaters in terms of stats meaning that they are slow, strong, bulky, etc. They have body armor that protects them from melee damage which is irrelevant in this game, they almost make them very much distinguishable from other variants.


### 2.0 Maps

TWR provides an assorted list of maps randomly chosen by the game at the end of each game(when wave 15 is beaten or a wave has been lost). Each map has its pros and cons along with camping spots due to their different fundemental nature meaning that you will have to incorporate different strategies to strive until the end of wave 15. In Cabin you would like to free run during late waves constantly whereas in expressway you have to stay on the right side and constantly shoot the zombies.

Here is a list of the maps with some info on them.

* Bypass

  A map that has 2 bridges that connects to the main part of it; flat terrain that is occupied by a small plaza, medical tents, barracks with a bunch of abandoned vehicles on the road that can be climbed on. Past the fortified bridge, there is a tunnel with a loot in them and doors where one of them leads to a camping spot. The zombies can spawn from the hill, from the tunnel, the bridge and around the fortitifed bridge.

* Mill

  A snowy map with a tunnel that is supposedly the same one in bypass and a bridge at the other side of the road that leads to a mountain pass path. This large map has an office place, a small cabin, a gas station, a warehouse, a forest and a factory. The factory's catwalks is a good camping spot and the zombies can run into the trees.

* Ranch

  Like its name suggests it, this map is a ranch with barns, a house and a small green house. The map is super vast and has fence that can be used to jump over and slow down infected.

* Expressway

  This map is a one-way map in other words the enemies spawn on one side and try to get you at the other one. This can either be problematic or an advantage; your teammates can be a burden and ruin everything by not staying on the right side. Staying on the right side allows zombies to line up and be shot down with ease. This map has a lot of vehicles and loot everywhere from the base to the edge of the map.

* Manor

  Manor is a relatively large map that can be considered as a maze for newcomers due to the amount of rooms and halls in it. The zombies come from around the wall. Since there are dozens of rooms, the relevant ones are the library, office, objectives located in specific rooms and the garage. It's worth noting that the garden situated at the center of the manor can be used as a shortcut to traverse from the front to the rear of the manor instead of running around it.
  
* Cabin

  Easily the most hated map due to its darkness and difficulty during later waves. Cabin has a cabin with a little amount of rooms and a basement, beyond that there is a truck near the cabin and a forest that encircles it. Camping in the basement is a bad idea and you should resort to free-running. The porch is really useful when freerunning because it provides loots. Zombies spawn from everywhere in the forest.
  
* District

  Just like Cabin, district is a fairly isolated and restricted map leaving not as much space to run in as other maps. It has 3 shooting places supposedly used by survivors before the players, a gas station, a movie theater and an apartment. Zombies come from multiple openings including the ground floor in the apartment and shooting spots.
  
* Prison

  Similarly to Manor, Prison is a pretty vast and has a lot of places for beginners to get lost in. There are multiple prison cell rooms, a kitchen, a mess hall, laundry, chapel, shower room, basketball court, outdoors gym. Outside of the main entrance there are police cars and a bus. Zombies spawn around the prison's perimeter.

* Cargo
  
  This map has a dark lighting setting similar to Cabin, it has a lot of cargo crates, a couple of medical tents and a ship that provides excellent camping spots. Like District, the zombies come from specific openings which are the ripped wire fences in this map.


### 3.0 Looting

Looting is essential in twr because you will definitely run out of ammo or take some damage. You can also loot fortifications, throwables and some items that'll buff your character.

Here are the throwables listed :

* Frag

  The classic frag grenade, explodes after shortly after thrown and deals explosive damage.

* Molotov

  Also referred to as the "molly", when thrown it'll break and create a fire AOE and deal fire damage.

* Nerf gas

  Creates an AOE of gas slowing down the infected within it.

Medical and non fortification loots are here :

* Medkit

  Heals a survivor to full health, it is ideal to use when your health is low.

* Bandages

  Heals a bar of health.

* Body armor

  Provides body armor, reduces physical damage by 50%. Physical means that bloater spores and burster gas bypass body armor.

* Ammo

  Adds ammunition into the player's ammo pool, usually a mag. It is ideal to not pick up a box of ammo when you don't need to so you won't waste any.

* Energy drink

  Increases player's walkspeed while the player is under its effect, lasts for 30 seconds.

Fortifications will be listed in the fortification chapter.


### 4.0 Objectives

Objectives in twr are tasks that you can perform. Upon completion, you will be awarded a mutable amount of credits and xp depending on the objective. Here are the objectives in the game :

* Escort

  You have to escort a survivor until you get awarded. 3000 credits and 1500 xp

* Radio/Communications/etc

  You stay in the circle for at least 30% to be awarded. A heli will arrive and drop a supply package which is the only way of acquiring a 50 cal. 1500 credits and 750 xp

* Resources

  Stay in the circle for at least 30% to be awarded just like Radio, you will have a bunch of supplies upon finishing the objective. To differeniate between ammo and medical supplies, you can find an ak47 on the objective whenever it objective supplies ammo. 2000 credits and 1000 xp

* Fill

  There's a bus and you have to fill it with resources, found in the map : water, propane, can packages, generator, toolbox. 3000 credits and 1500 xp

* Repair

  To repair the broken-down car, you have to find spark plugs, fuel and tires. 3000 credits and 1500 xp

* Destroy

  There's a gas truck, destroy it to cause an explosion with a fire field similar to the molotovs'. 5000 credits and 2000 xp

Both the repair and fill objectives require you to only pick up one item for you to be rewarded whenever accomplished but it is recommended to still help in order to actually finish it. Doing objectives at bad spots can get egregious for those who do it. Doing radio near infected spawns at wave 15 is suicidal, hence egregious.


### 5.0 Weapons

Weapons are mostly what keep you alive in this game, so you have to buy the proper ones and learn to use them the right way(s) as well. There are various weapons in this game but I will mention the ones relevant in this game; buying the proper ones is good to not waste any credits on buying the latter ones.

#### Primaries :

  * Mossberg(12)

    Deals the amount of damage a shotgun would(high) and a decent first guy to buy.

  * Aero survival(14)

    Decent mag size and damage for a low level primary.

  * M4A1(32)

    Ideal mag size for low levels, good damage, iron sight

  * SKO Shorty(33)

    Max damage, excellent rate of fire for a shotgun, bad recoil(expected from a shotgun), most likely one of the best guns to buy before RPK.

  * AK-47S(38)

    Same clip size as M4A1, higher damage and bullet punch, worse recoil

  * RPK(52)

    A better AK-47 in every sense besides recoil, has a larger mag size, an iron sight, better damage

  * LWRC(56)

    RPK is better than LWRC in most cases because it is deemed as the ammo burner; it can shoot more bullets than necessary whenever tap firing which convolutes everything thus sticking with RPK is recommended.

  * Flamethrower(65)

    This one is good but not overpowered, it deals slightly more damage than the M60 does and additionally inflicts the same fire effect as the molotov does, has more ammunition(100/200) and has infinite bullet punch limit due to the flames going through infected. Its drawbacks is the lack of range compared to every other gun meaning that your kills can get stolen easily and sniping is not possible.

  * M60(75)

    This primary is simply overpowered; high ammunition(100/100), high damage, high bullet punch, good recoil. Its drawback is its slow reload time which can be made up for by using the brisk perk or simply reloading when there are no zombies nearby.

  * Barrett(100)

    This weapon rivals the M60, the answer to M60 vs Barrett is arbitrary since it depends on people's playstyle. Barrett has a noticeably way less ammunition than the M60 does(10 bullets in each mag) but it deals maximum damage and has the maximum amount of bullet punch as well. It has a superior reloading time as expected and has maximum magnification which is useful for sniping from behind but it's as good while freerunning.

#### Secondaries :

  * Serbu(10)

    A lot of people tend to stick with it due to its high damage and bullet punch(can pierce through 1 infected)

  * Uzi(28)

    No bullet punch, fast firerate, mag size of 25, low damage, not very recommended

  * Taurus(32)

    This is like the Colt python but weaker, since they're both revolvers.

  * Skorpion EVO(48)

    Has bullet punch, faster firerate than uzi, more damage, mag size of 20

  * Gepard(64)

    The Gepard PDW is fairly similar to the Skorpion EVO, it deals slightly more damage, it has a slower rate of fire, a worse recoil, a worse magnification and a better reload time.

  * Colt Python(70)

    The colt python isn't really the best choice for a secondary since there's the deagle, it has a slower rate of fire, a way worse recoil and a smaller mag size than the deagle's.

  * HK(80)

    HK is an ideal secondary, it deals more damage than a M60 does(can 1 shot bursters on the head at wave 15), enough bullet punch to pierce through one infected enemy, has twice more clip than the deagle does and a good recoil.

  * Deagle(90)

    A better colt python, some people fight between Deagle and HK but the it's the same solution as with M60 vs Barrett therefore the better secondary is subjective, they literally have the same differences.

#### Melees :

  * Sabre(78)

    Why not, it can decapitate zombies, deals a lot of damage.

  * Katana(85)

    It has some slight differences in comparison with the Sabre, it's slower but deals more damage, etc.

I'd say that buying weapons early is most definitely worth it if they're endgame ones, but I recommend to buy the least amount of weapons as possible. Buying skins is pretty irrelevant when you don't have a decent gun as well because I saw people with neon skins on an Aero Survival Rifle and they died within the first minute. I recommend to buy weapons in the order below.

Primary : **Mossberg** > **SKO Shorty** > **RPK** > **M60**

Secondary : **Serbu** > **HK**/**Deagle**

Melee : **Sabre**/**Katana**

### 6.0 Perks

Using the proper perks is crucial and can affect your odds of survival; using trigger finger while equipping an SMG is futile but using brisk with an M60 is flawless. Here's a list of relevant perks at certain level thresholds :

10 : There's only one combo possible

20 : Bruiser(Reduce damage effect aka screen shaking), Playmaker(extra clap bomb), Trigger finger(faster rate of fire for non auto guns)

30 : Medic(bandages heal 30%), Playmaker, Trigger finger

45 : Medic, Fortifier(ability to pick up 2 extra barbed wire), Heavy hitter(10% more damage for upper body shots)

60 : Medic, Adrenaline rush(slowly regenerate to 25% when under that threshold), Fortifier, Heavy hitter

85 : Adrenaline rush, Speed demon(Sprinting is 12% faster), Carpenter(building speed increased by 25%), Fortifier, Heavy hitter

100 : Holy trinity(Guardian angel, Juggernaut, Overwatch), Speed demon, Carpenter, Fortifier

You can now forge your own build with the recommended perks. For the full list of perks here's the [wiki](https://those-who-remain.fandom.com/wiki/Perks).


### 7.0 Fortification

Fortifications are quite useful in TWR whether you're free running or camping; placing clap bombs can be useful when a horde is following and using barbed wire to slow down infected to shoot them down is also ideal. Here's the list of fortifications in this game :

* Barbed wire

  Slows down infected while dealing damage to them with a barbed wire bonus if your barbed wire manages to finish off infected.

  There are multiple ways to place barbed wire here's a [video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/451820214187720716/817515835085946951/Screen_Recording_2021-03-05_at_4.54.12_PM.mov) that displays 2 of them, one of them allows the placement of more adjacent barbed wires while covering a width to affect more infected while the other is for slowing down the zombies for longer. This placement method takes advantage of zombies' pathfinding that always takes the shortest route towards its target.



* Clap bomb

  Explosive that denotes when zombies are within the proper vicinity.

* Jack

  A timed explosive that blows up after 10 seconds after its placement, it can be used for the destroy objective.

* 50 cal

  This fortification, with an overpowered bullet punch and damage, can destroy large hordes with relative ease. It's usually used for camping as a final stand during wave 15 since using it during early waves is a waste of bullets due to its infrequency as well. You shouldn't be wasting its ammunition by spraying, tap firing is more than enough just like with every other gun. Note that there's an on-going glitch with the 50 cal; if you die or finish a wave on the cal you won't be able to walk next wave.


### 8.0 Grinding

**Expressway** :

There are plenty of ways to grind in TWR. The most efficient map to farm in is objectively expressway due to its difference in structure. Staying on the right side of the map is the best way to go because aligning all the zombies allows for maximum efficiency for bullet punch and everything in general. Thus placing traps like barbed wire and throwing molotovs at the right side of the map are considered to be effective at farming credits. That also means that placing barbed wire at the base is irrelevant.

**Cabin** :

Cabin is a quite difficult map to both camp and freerun in, of course freerunning is better. Using the flamethrower in that map is super useful due to the large amount of zombies following you that can be killed.

**General** :

Preliminarily preparing for late waves like getting the 50 cal is also crucial because you can get a decent amount of credits from them. Surviving while doing objectives is probably one of the best ways to make credits in general if you're a low level because fighting a large horde is an audacious move without guardian angel users. Shooting down zombies with a decent gun is totally fine to earn money but it isn't as rewarding in some maps.

**Leveling** :

Leveling up is quite simple too, just server hop into servers with late waves. Although I recommend doing objectives for low levels since late waves can be redundantly difficult for low levels without much xp to benefit from, map completion bonuses(surviving wave 15) can give around 30k credits at around level 90.


### 9.0 Tactics and playstyles

There are many methods to survive waves in TWR.

**Free-running** :

Free-running being often chosen by high levels, it's easy to do and bloaters nor bursters will be able to get you. Handling militaries and bolters are usually the nuisance when it comes to free-running without speed demon, militaries are proven to be troublesome even with speed demon.

Using barbed wire to slow down zombies is very efficient for those who don't have speed demon, placing them around the cabin and free-running around the cabin for 5 minutes is a way to do so instead of surrounding the basement with barbed wire. This strategy can also be applied in district.

Using obstacles to slow down zombies is also another way to do it; using obstacles you can jump on since zombies tend to run into them for a bit before jumping over them or running in forests and let the zombies run into the trees. Players shouldn't be ignoring the fact that zombies take some time before updating their target's position which can be used to confuse the zombies or make them take longer to reach to you.

Leading a horde to a molotov fire hitbox or nerf gas, whatever thing you can use to dispose the zombies is a useful strategy hence learning how to time jacks, clap bombs, etc can make players more proficient at surviving.

**Camping** :

This strategy is ineffective without the proper fortification and equipment and can cost your victory as well. This should only be done during wave 15 or be done at the correct places. Using barbed wire to reinforce where the zombies would come from is ideal as well. There are two ways to place barbed wire. In Mill, there's the catwalks in the factory, jumping from there would be a good idea in case of getting overrun or someone bursted.

**Sewer run** :

If zombies are about to overrun your camp sewer running is a good thing to do. Take an energy drink run to somewhere and use a quick method to get rid of the infected following or not.
